How to compile and run:
   The Makefile contains the following three targets:
      - clean: deletes all output files.
      - build (default): compiles the software
      - run: launches the application.

   To compile and run, execute 'make run'.

   To run against all .smf files, execute 'make run_all'.

There are currently some issues with the application:
1. The shading is a little harsh - not sure if that's normal.
2. The rotation around objects is a little off when the object
   is not centered at the origin in the .smf.
3. For some reason, the object are skewed to the side and are
   not centered in view. lo-sphere.smf shows up in the center,
   but nothing else.
4. The increasing/decreasing the height of the camera work,
   but the moving in/out only really works in perspective
   projection.

P.S. This has been a very challenging assignment.
