How to compile and run:
   To compile and run both 2d and 3d shading, run 'make' or 'make run_all'.

   To work with just 2d shading, run the following targets while setting APP=shapes_a7:
      make APP=shapes_a7 clean
      make APP=shapes_a7 build
      make APP=shapes_a7 run

   To work with just 3d shading, run the following targets while setting APP=shapes_a6:
      make APP=shapes_a6 clean
      make APP=shapes_a6 build
      make APP=shapes_a6 run


   For 3d shading, to run using an alternative patch file, build it and then run like this:
      ./shapes_a6 <path to file>
   e.g. ./shapes_a6 models/patchPoints.txt
