How to compile and run:
   The Makefile contains the following three targets:
      - clean: deletes all output files.
      - build (default): compiles the software
      - run: launches the application.

   To compile and run, execute 'make run'.

   To run using an alternative patch file, build it and then run like this:
      ./shapes <path to file>
   e.g. ./shapes models/patchPoints.txt

There are currently some issues with the application:
1. The control point size is small. I had tried various things to
   make them bigger with no luck.
2. Because the control points are small - the coloring of the selected point
   is hard to see.
