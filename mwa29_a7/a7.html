<h2>Interactive Computer Graphics: Assignment 7</h2>
<h3>Bezier Patch</h3>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Topics:
</p><ul>
<!--	<li>Bezier Curves: Drawing a cubic Bezier curve from a set of given control points</li> -->
	<li>Bezier Patches: Drawing a bicubic Bezier patch from a set of given control points</li>
	<li>Interaction: User has the ability to interactively change
	the location of a control point and the resolution of the
	patch tessellation</li>
</ul>

<p>

Create a program that draws a smooth-shaded bicubic Bezier patch to
the screen.
<br>
The initial control points for the patch are provided
in a text file.<br>
The file format will be 3 floating point numbers per
line, with 16 lines.<br>
X-Y Ordering: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [0,1], [1,1], [2,1], etc.
<p>
Tessellate the patch into triangles and calculate a surface normal for
each triangle vertex.<br>
Initially the patch should be sampled with a
10 x 10 resolution.
<p>
You will draw the patch and the control points (as GL_POINTS) for the
patch.
<p>
Also draw the X, Y and Z axes.
<p>
INTERACTION:
<p>
The user should be able to change the view of the patch.
<p>
The user should have the capability to choose a control point to modify, 
via keyboard interaction.
<br>
Change the color and/or size of the selected control point.
<br>
The user can then change the
location of the selected point via 6 keyboard
buttons (increase/decrease x/y/z position).
<p>
The user should be able to increase and decrease the sampling
of the patch with a keyboard interaction.
<p> 
The user should also be able to switch between smooth (using the Phong
model) and flat diffuse-only shading.
