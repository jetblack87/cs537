How to compile and run:
   The Makefile contains the following three targets:
      - clean: deletes all output files.
      - build (default): compiles the software
      - run: launches the applications (once the first one is closed, the second will open).

   To compile and run, execute 'make run'.


This assignment contains two programs: shapes.cpp and shapes_part2.cpp.
