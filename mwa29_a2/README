How to compile and run:
   The Makefile contains the following three targets:
      - clean: deletes all output files.
      - build (default): compiles the software
      - run: launches the application

   To compile and run, execute 'make run'.


The program has been modified from the original triangles.cpp to also
draw a quadrilateral and a pentagon.

The following changes were made to the application:

   # The vertices array was modified to contain vertices for all three
     shapes:
    vec2 vertices[ TriangleNumPoints  QuadrilateralNumPoints  PentagonNumPoints ] = {
      vec2( -0.75, 0.10 ), // Triangle
      vec2( -0.50, 0.75 ),
      vec2( -0.25, 0.10 ),
      vec2( 0.10, 0.10 ),  // Quadrilateral
      vec2( 0.10, 0.75 ),
      vec2( 0.50, 0.90 ),
      vec2( 0.50, 0.25 ),
      vec2(  0.0,  -0.80), // Pentagon
      vec2( -0.38, -0.52 ),
      vec2( -0.24, -0.10 ),
      vec2(  0.24, -0.10 ),
      vec2(  0.38, -0.52 )


   # The glDrawArrays call was duplicated for each shape:
    glDrawArrays( GL_POLYGON, 0, TriangleNumPoints );
    glDrawArrays( GL_POLYGON, TriangleNumPoints,  QuadrilateralNumPoints );
    glDrawArrays( GL_POLYGON, TriangleNumPoints + QuadrilateralNumPoints, PentagonNumPoints );
